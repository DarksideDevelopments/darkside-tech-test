# Darkside Developments Technical Test

## Introduction

Welcome to the Darkside Developments Test!

We hope that you find this exercise fun. There are no trick questions; we want to see your solution to a simple problem with well thought-out and well structured code.

## The Brief

The objective of this exercise is to develop a straightforward form that can save and update customer information, such as name, email, phone, and address, to a database. The preferred technologies for this task are PHP, specifically with the Laravel framework, for the server-side, and VueJS for the client-side.

Please ensure that any client-side code adheres to the same principles as the server-side code. Additionally, it is essential to follow engineering best practices throughout the project.

The principles we prioritize include security, performance, readability, testability, scalability, and simplicity. Please incorporate these principles into your solution.

Furthermore, strive to achieve a clear separation of concerns between the various components of your solution. Utilizing the MVC pattern, for instance, can facilitate this separation.

If Docker is not utilized, your application should retrieve and store data by reading from and writing to a file on disk, instead of utilizing a relational or NoSQL solution for the datastore.

## The Deliverable

* A .zip / git repository link (with access)
* A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.
* Any instructions required to run your solution and tests in a Linux environment.
