# Darkside Developments Technical Test

## Introduction

Welcome to the Darkside Developments Test!

We hope that you find this exercise fun. There are no trick questions; We want to see your solution to a simple problem with well thought-out and well structured code.

## What is being Tested?

This simple skill assessment will test the following skills/abilities:

- The ability to read and understand documentation. *A couple of handy ones for this test would be:* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/readme) | [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/) | [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) ~ [ *Preferably Composition API* ].
- Your problem solving skills and your ability to handle difficult tasks.
- Your knowledge and ability of Git version control.
- PHP language skills and understanding.
- JavaScript language skills and undertsanding.
- Your understanding of MVC framework concepts *Models, Views, Controllers*, such as Laravel.
- Your ability to work in a full stack environment.
- Your ability to find bugs, work out why they are bugs/not valid code, then fix them.
- Your ability to validate and sanitize form data from a frontend form.
- Your understanding of responsive first design and building for devices of all sizes.

## The Brief

The objective of this exercise is to develop a straightforward form that can save and update customer information, such as name, email, phone, and address, to a database. The preferred technologies for this task are PHP, specifically with the Laravel framework for the server-side, and VueJS for the client-side.

Please ensure that any client-side code adheres to the same principles as the server-side code. Additionally, it is essential to follow engineering best practices throughout the project.

The principles we prioritize include security, performance, readability, testability, scalability, and simplicity. Please incorporate these principles into your solution.

Furthermore, strive to achieve a clear separation of concerns between the various components of your solution. Utilizing the MVC pattern, for instance, can facilitate this separation.

If Docker is not utilized, your application should retrieve and store data by reading from and writing to a file on disk, instead of utilizing a relational or NoSQL solution for the datastore.

## The Deliverable

* A .zip / git repository link (with access)
* A covering note//README.md explaining the technology choices you have made. Please include any instructions required to run your solution and tests in a Linux environment.
